# Image analysis basics

This chapter covers image processing and image analysis basics. We will introduce what images are and how we can process them. We will be mostly using the [numpy library](https://numpy.org), [scipy](https://scipy.org/) and [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org) and you can install them using pip:

```
pip install numpy scipy scikit-image
```

or conda:
```
conda install numpy scipy scikit-image
```

We will also take a first look at some more advanced libraries, which can be used for image processing, namely [cupy](https://cupy.dev) and [pyclesperanto](https://github.com/clesperanto/pyclesperanto_prototype). You find the installation instructions for those in the respective sections.
